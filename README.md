# CNN-Based-Waste-Classification-Using-BDWaste-Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories using the BDWaste dataset. The dataset consists of 2,625 real-world waste images categorized into 21 distinct classes. By training and evaluating multiple CNN architectures, this project identifies the most effective model for waste classification and optimizes its performance using hyperparameter tuning.
